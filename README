This is a from the scratch, large scale, project, I have
other project to work on to, so this will take a while. If
you want to help, I suggest taking a look into the issue
list an work on some ‘ponify’ or ‘suggest’ maked subproject.
Even if this project does not succeed, those would not have
been in vain, they can easily be used on any distro.


To get started you will need to clone three repostories,
the downloaded directories should be placed in the same
superdirectory:

git clone git://github.com/GNU-Pony/live-medium.git
git clone git://github.com/GNU-Pony/initram.git
git clone git://github.com/GNU-Pony/spike.git

Then, `cd` into `live-medium`, read the readme and
execute `make` accordingly.


* I believe there are dialects where the gemination is missing.



---------- Distribution highlights ----------


Rolling relase (planned), for bleeding edge software.

The official package repositories are community operated.

Package manager built on top of git at builds packages
from souce and lets you do modification the a packages
once and the modification will be preserved with newer
versions of the package.

It is what you make it, but Sparkle can help you.

Free software only (when the kernel has been switched
to Linux-libre,) with opt-in support for community provided
non-free software.

Minimalistic and simplistic (from developers point of view.)

No install CD, you built your live USB-medium but can choose
to make changes so that is can be used for anything else.
You can even work without a storage device, just remove
your swap parition and build the live medium to it
instread of a USB and boot it instead.

Well documented: all distribution specific packages
are documented with texinfo (not man), and configuration
files include much of the documentation directly where it
is needed.
