This is a from the scratch, large scale, project, I have
other project to work on to, so this will take a while.
If you want to help, I suggest taking a look into the
issue list an work on some "ponify" maked subproject.
Even if this project does not succeed, those would not
have been in vain, they can easily be used on any distro.
