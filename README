This is a from the scratch, large scale, project, I have
other project to work on to, so this will take a while. If
you want to help, I suggest taking a look into the issue
list an work on some ‘ponify’ or ‘suggest’ maked subproject.
Even if this project does not succeed, those would not have
been in vain, they can easily be used on any distro.


To get started you will need to clone three repostories,
the downloaded directories should be placed in the same
superdirectory:

git clone git://github.com/GNU-Pony/live-medium.git
git clone git://github.com/GNU-Pony/initram.git
git clone git://github.com/GNU-Pony/spike.git

Then, `cd` into `live-medium`, read the readme and
execute `make` accordingly.
