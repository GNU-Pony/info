Linguistical consistency is an important part
of projects of any type of work. Documentation,
project names, comments and anything literate
should be written, before translation, in one
language in one variant, with a consistent
style both in spelling and typography.

For GNU/Pony we have selected the Britsh
English, which is outside America, is accepted
an international language, and its though in
schools. For spelling, -ise is prefered over
-ize, but, beware that some words can only be
correctly spelled with -ize.

Before and while working on documentation, you
should read:

http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf

This is important as writing style difference
between languages as well as variants of languages,
for example quotations are done mutally differently
in American English, British English, Swedish and
German.
