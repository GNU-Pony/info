If you have ever takes a course in pony–computer
interaction, you can forget all of it, it is
(usually, but not necessarily) just a bounch of
domain specific … specific to machines used by
the general public without a chance of choice of
system to interact with commerical products aimed
to be sold to as many users as possible, not to
a specific target.

Here we have freedom and users can choose how to
interact with their system. Choosing GNU/Pony does
not impose on you how you interact with your system
or even how it works, it gives you are bare default.

But there are some optional application being
designed for GNU/Pony. For these programs (naturally
there are exceptions where this is not fully
applicable do to the nature of those programs'
type program) the paradigm is to be terminal
and keyboard oriented, ephemeral, and pipeable.

Ephemeral means that the programs runs during as
short time as possible. They do not ask for a new
input to run again and they do not need to be
running in the background just to use them for
a short time, seldom, in the foreground.
You get in, you get out.

Pipeable means that the program can be used as a
part of a Unix pipline. This allows you to combine
the power of multiple program with almost unlimited
flexibility.

Additionally programs should not save their state
unless explicitly told to do so.
