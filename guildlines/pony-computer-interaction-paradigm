If you have ever takes a course in pony–computer
interaction, you can forget all of it, is is just
a bounch of domain specific … specific to machines
used by the general public without choice of system
to interact with an commerical products aimed to
be sold to as many users as possible, not to a
specific target.

Here we have freedom and users can choose how to
interact with their system. Choosing GNU/Pony does
not impose on you how you interact with your system
or even how it works, it gives you are bare default.

But there is some optional application being designed
for GNU/Pony, for these programs (naturally there are
exceptions where this is not fully applicable do to
the nature of those programs' type program) the
paradigm is to be terminal and keyboard oriented
ephemeral, and pipeable.

Ephemeral means that the programs runs during as short
time as possible. The do not ask for a new input to
run again and the do not need to be running in the
background just to use them for a short time, seldom,
in the foreground. You get in, you get out.

Pipeable means that the program can be used as a
part of a Unix pipline.
