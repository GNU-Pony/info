Programs should be signed to be as small, functionwise,
as possible. This reduces the size of the code, the number
of bugs, and the complexity of program. And often, the
memory usage of the program, which unused RAM is wasted
RAM, wasted RAM is still wasted RAM.

Programs should however be signed to be customisable and
extensible. The simplest way to do this is to break
the code into as many functions as possible, and allow
those fucntions to be replaced, and extended (with union
function constructs.) If you use Python, just executing
a dot will do as all functions actually modifiable
variables. For shell scripts, you can do the same thing,
but you will need a variable with the name of the function,
so that each extension can define a function the uses
the already existing function and tell the program which
function is the new function.
