Programs that will never break backwards compatibility
or must never break backwards compatibility (notifications
will be published in good time before that happens) just
have a timestamp as its version number. The timestamp is
the time the `git tag -a` command was used. The timestamp
is the POSIX time rounded down to nearest second. The
difference of two timestamps can be used to guess how
large the changeset of the update is, however stable
programs will be updates quite seldom.

Other programs' versions are formated as MAJOR.MINOR and
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH when PATCH > 0. MAJOR is zero on all
versions before the first version that is considered
stable (which will be 1.0), and is increased only on
breakage of backwards incompatability. MINOR and PATCH
is reset to zero when MAJOR and MAJOR or MINOR,
respectively is increased. MINOR is increased on
regular updates, PATCH is increased for minor changes
that fixes a small release mistake or minor bug
that broke backwards incompatability.
