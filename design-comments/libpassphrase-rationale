In my first year at the university the computer
rooms hade Solaris thin clients and the graphical
login manager had echoing disabled when the user
entered the passphrase. This confused new students
that hade to be told that the passphrase feild is
supposted to be blank while you are filling it.

Today on GNU machines this is rather uncommon in
graphical programs, but there are still places
this occurs in, namely in terminal programs, and
new users will use some of them.

libpassphrase allows you to choose to make terminal
programs' passphrase fields behave like those of
graphical programs. But it also allows you to disable
things you do not care about. Or to rewrite it
completely if it cannot do what you want it to do,
and all programs that takes advantage of libpassphrase
will use your implementation.
