In my first year at the university the computer
rooms hade Solaris thin clients. On this system
the graphical login manager had echoing disabled
when the user entered the passphrase. This
confused new students, and many of them hade to
be told that the passphrase field is supposted
to be blank while you are entering your passphrase.

Today on GNU machines this is rather uncommon in
graphical programs, but there are still places
this occurs in, namely in terminal programs, and
new users will use some of them. For example, in
schools you are tools to change your passphrase
the first time you log in, and you are told to
do so by opening a terminal and run `passwd`.

libpassphrase allows you to choose to make
terminal programs' passphrase fields behave like
those of graphical programs. But it also allows
you to disable things you do not care about.
Or to rewrite it completely if it cannot do what
you want it to do, and all programs that takes
advantage of libpassphrase will use your
implementation.
