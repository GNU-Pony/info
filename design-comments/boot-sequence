While systemd is great project it is known to be problematic for
some computers, therefore I have choosen the tried and true sysvinit
with rc scripts written in bash, which is also in my opinion a
easier technology.

In addition to just using initscripts from Arch Linux, I have made
modification to make it easier to set up multihoming and runlevel
dependent daemons, but I have also changed the runlevel definitions
by adding definitions to runlevel 2 and 4:

    0     Shutdown
    1(S)  Single-user (system maintainance)
    2     Networkless single-user
    3     Multi-user (regular boot with console, which can start graphics)
    4     Networkless multi-user
    5     Multi-user with display manager (regular boot with graphics)
    6     Reboot

But the first step in the boot is the MBR and bootloader, for which I
have choosen SYSLINUX, because, frankly, I abhor GRUB.
