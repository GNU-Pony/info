For Spike I have choosen the language Python.

The reason for this is that Python is both simpler and easier to find good documentation
for than BASH, although there are languages, such as Java, that has better documentation.

The code written in Python is also in general small and it does not the be compiled, which
is important to reduce the size of the downloaded repositories, the latter should also improve
the overall speed as compiling takes long time (although not too long if you do not compile to
machine code) and packages are heavy duty and are not interpreted to often.

Selecting a cross-platform language is also preferable as it increases the portability,
and Python is cross-platform while supporting platform specific functions.

However if Python breaks backwards compatibilty (change the specifications for a function
or changes the syntax as they did when making Python 3) we have 3 options: rewrite all
scrolls, execute different version of Python depending on the version the scroll was written
in, and do not use the newer version. With languages such as BASH and Java this does not
happen*.


* Java may change implementation details (such as swithing between using a stabil and
unstabile sorting algorithm), can change the behaviour of programs, but that rarely
happens and can easily be circumvented.
