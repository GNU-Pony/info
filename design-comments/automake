To spike scroll will install the command automake,
rather, if you really want it, you need to create
it in /usr/local/bin.

The reason for not having the automake command is
that it breaks compatability between versions and
it is better to have one command for each version
that needs to be used explicity so you always new
which version you are using and scrolls do not need
to be updated because it uses the command automake.
