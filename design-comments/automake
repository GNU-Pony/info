GNU Automake is somewhat frequently updates.
But there is generally a break in backwards
compatability between version. Because of this,
there will be no automake command in GNU/Pony,
rather each version of automake will have its
own command so the version will be used
explicitly in Spike scrolls. If you despite
the backwards incompatability what to have a
`automake` command you need to create a symlink
in /usr/local/bin.
