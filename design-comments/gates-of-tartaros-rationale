Before Gates of Tartaros I used agetty. But I wanted a My Little Pony
to be displayed. To do this I forked agetty to support kmsponies from
ponysay and added Luna to my /etc/issue file (I also added a few more
capabilities.) The problem with this was to it was always to same pony.

This was not that great, and to top it of, the agetty code is very
bloated and you have to bloat it even more to add new features. Gates
of Tartaros is just POSIX shell script program with cirka 100 line
— many of the lines are just function and variable declarations to
allow function onion:ings and replacements for extensibility — that
sources the /etc/gotrc file which allows you to modify and extend the
entire behaviour of Gates of Tartaros. The only thing Gates of Tartaros
does if it is not extended is print a small prompt, read the user name
and starts either `login` or `ssh` (depending on whether it included
an at-sign), fixes the TTY settings, and exports the TERM variable.

So by itself Gates of Tartaros just does what is really required to
perform a login on a virtual terminal, and to use SSH which is just
added by default because it does not really bloat the program, and
is very useful, at least for me. If this is not enough, you can
choose tom for example, support baudrate configurations (for serial
terminals). But back to the reason for writing Gates of Tartaros in
the first place, Gates of Tartaros comes with a code you can add or
source in /etc/gotrc, optionally modified, that uses ponysay to get
a My Little Pony that it puts in the lower left corner of the screen.
