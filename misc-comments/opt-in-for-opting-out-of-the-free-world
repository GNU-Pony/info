Software freedom is very important for me,
despite this the package manager, Spike, is
lets you opt-in for proprietary software.
This is not too common among GNU/Linux
distributions, they either do not care about
user freedom, or are enforces freedom.
The only exception I know of this is Parabola
GNU/Linux where you have to remove your-freedom
(a package conflict with proprietary packages
available in Arch Linux) before you can
install proprietary packages. The problem
in Parabola is that it uses AUR without
restrictions. In GNU/Linux you have to
configure what restrictions Spike buts on
packages to install or even find them.

Only allowing free packages is naïve.
If try to convert a pony, schooled into
using a proprietary system that very
different from GNU/Linux (such as Windows),
into using GNU/Linux, she will run back,
“her” proprietary system and never let
go, if you do not do this in a long
transitional phase. Letting transitioners
using proprietary packages is not to
take their freedom way, it is to not
give it in its entirety as fast, which
is quite different. But you still tell
them that they should only use it
temporarly and transition away from them
when they fill comfortable with the new
system.
