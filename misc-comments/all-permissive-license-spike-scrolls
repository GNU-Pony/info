No competent court would ever rule that package installation
scripts are copyright protected or copyright protectable,
because of there nature or lack of originality they are
ineligible for copyright protection. If there was just one
type of software other than Hello World in the world that
this not original enough for copyright protections it is
instructions on how to install a program.

But just to be on the safe side Spike scrolls are licensed
under the GNU All Permissive License. This license gives you
the same rights as if it was public domain, except (and this
is the differences from WTFPL) it all derivatives must have*
the same license so that they too are treated as public
domain.


* The license does not technically say this, but anypony
  that is not about to argue on semantics will agree with
  that interpretation.
