Dispite that nopony has asked, I am going to state here why ‘Linux’
has not been included in the distribution name which is otherwise
a common practice.

I do not want to tie GNU/Pony to a specific kernel, I would love to
see ponies use all types of (free) kernels, without having to make a
spinoff distribution. Specifically, I am looking forward to using
GNU Hurd instead of Linux. Rather then spinning, it should be
possible to simply select the kernel and set of base packages
associated with that kernel. Additional, it might be possible — I do
not know, because I do not know that I has been done before — to
multi-kernel an installation, allowing you to select which kernel
to use when booting with the installed packages being tied to that
kernel.

Moreover, ‘GNU/Pony’ was the first thing that came to me when I
was thinging of a name, and I think it that just rolls right of
the tongue (unless you pronounce it with ‘slash’.)

Further, Linux is associated with Open Source, I am an advocate
of Free Software, and I do not agree with the basic values of
Open Source, although I do not disagree with the benfits they see.

Linux also has an incorrect stigma of not being pony friendly and
I would love it if ponies introduce GNU/Pony to ponies that have
not used GNU/Linux before. It would help if they do not immediately
associate it Linux because of the name and thinks it is not usable.
I do think that GNU/Linux is easy to use for any user, provided
that it comes with a graphical environment, especially for those
that has not yet been schooled in to a philosophy of computing
used by a too different system. GNU/Pony might not be the best
choice for beginners, but I do think that with the help of a pony
friend beginners can use GNU/Pony.
