Dispite that nopony has asked, I am going to state here why ‘Linux’
has not been included in the distribution name.

I do not want to tie GNU/Pony a specific kernel, I would love to see
ponies using all types of (free) kernels, without having to make a
spin but rather just selecting adding it to the package repository.

The first thing I though of when coming up with a named was GNU/Pony,
I think that just rolls right of the tongue (unless you pronounce it
with ‘slash’.)

Linux is associated with Open Source, I am an advocate of Free Software.

Linux as an incorrect stigma of not being user friendly and I would
love it if ponies introduce GNU/Pony to users that have not used
GNU/Linux before, and it would help if they do not immediately associate
it Linux because of the name and thinks it is not usable.
