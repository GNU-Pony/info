           Passphrase was generated using atleast 40 characters,
           6 words (both significantly exceeded). And has been
           modified to include more than spaces and lower case.
           The word list included 27988 words of multiple languages
           and not only ASCII. The passphrase is random (using
           /dev/random), was only generated once, and does not
           for in whole or in part a grammatically acceptable
           sentence. GPG did not have any complaints on the
           passphrase. The passphrase has not been stored on
           the computer nor on-line, and after one week (I normal
           just have one day, but this passphrase is far more
           complex) of use I will burn the note no which it is
           written.
