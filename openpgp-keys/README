           Passphrase was generated using at least 40 characters,
           6 words (both significantly exceeded). And has been
           modified to include more than spaces and lower case.
           The word list included 27988 words of multiple languages
           and not only ASCII. The passphrase is random (using
           /dev/random), was only generated once, and does not
           for in whole or in part a grammatically acceptable
           sentence. GPG did not have any complaints on the
           passphrase. The passphrase has not been stored on
           the computer nor on-line, and after one week (I normal
           just have one day, but this passphrase is far more
           complex) of use I will burn the note on which it is
           written.

           Revocation certificates has been created. The revocation
           certificates have been encrypted and stored on an encrypted
           partition that is almost always unmounted, and will be
           moved to an encrypted USB-devices once I have bought a new
           USB-device for that. The revocation certificates, and all
           intermediate files to the final local, its was shred:ed in
           100 iterations and removed with wipesync.

Both key's passphrases was generated using at least 60 characters, 9 words.
And has been modified to include more than spaces and lower case. The word
list included 27988 words of multiple languages and not only ASCII. The
passphrase is random (using /dev/random), was only generated once, and does
not for in whole or in part a grammatically acceptable sentence. GPG did
not have any complaints on the passphrase.

Each key is sorted on a separate dedicated USB-device that was cleaned with
/dev/random and overwritten with /dev/urandom and then encrypted with
`cryptsetup --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-size 512 --hash sha512 --iter-time
20000 --use-random luksFormat`, each with its own long passphrases similar to
those generated by correctpony and has never been written down.

The GPG keys's passphrases has been stored encrypted on the other USB and
the GPG keys themself has also been stored encrypted (in addition the the
partition being encrypted.)

Each involved file not stored on the USB:s and the exported public key-only
keys have been shred:ed in 10000 iterations and removed with wipesync.

The computer used for creation of these keys was not connected to the
Internet or network, used encrypted partitions (including swap), and was
then reinstalled with new partition encryption.

The USB devices are stored on separate locations.

No revocation certificate has been create.
